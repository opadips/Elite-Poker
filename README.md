## ✨ Features
### 🏠 Lobby System
- **Lobby list** – browse available tables with player count, top score, mode, lock status, active players, blinds, and more.
- **Live table cards** – see active player count, blinds, starting chips, and—when a hand is in progress—the current pot size and round.
- **Create private/public tables** – set a name, description, password, blinds, starting chips (up to 1,000,000), and game mode (Tournament / Cash).
- **General chat** – chat with all online players before joining a table.
- **Online players panel** – see who is in the lobby.
- **Waitlist** – if a table is full (max 10 players), join the waitlist and be auto‑seated when a spot opens.
- **Admin controls** – only the table creator can reset the lobby or kick players.
- **Kick players** – admin can remove players from the table.
- **Return to lobby** – leave the table and go back to the lobby list without disconnecting.

### 🎤 A Dealer with Attitude
- A sarcastic, witty Dealer narrates every action—fold, call, raise, all‑in, and more—with over 100 unique lines.
- Dealer messages appear instantly at the top of the screen and fade after a moment.

### 🎮 Core Gameplay
- Full Texas Hold'em rules (preflop, flop, turn, river, blinds, side pots).
- Real‑time multiplayer via **WebSocket** (2–10 players per table).
- **Spectator mode** – watch the game and sit in with adjustable starting chips.
- **Side betting** – folded players can bet on active players (50% profit). In heads‑up scenarios where the opponent folds, the side bet is refunded to prevent abuse.
- **Tournament mode** – chips reset when one player remains; winner gets a point and everyone restarts with fresh chips.
- **Cash mode** – chips accumulate across hands (no forced reset).
- **Auto‑action timer** – 20 seconds per turn; auto‑check or auto‑fold on time‑out. The active player’s card is wrapped with a sleek neon progress ring that changes colour from blue → green → orange → red.
- **Pause / Resume** – pause the game anytime (pauses auto‑fold timers), with player attribution.

### 🎨 Visual & UX
- **6 polished themes** with pure CSS backgrounds (no external files):
  - `Classic` · `Royal Crimson` · `Emerald Luxe` · `Sapphire Noir` · `Neon Jungle` · `Void Pulse`
- **Card back customization** (6 designs) – saved in `localStorage`.
- **Seat view** – fixed (your seat always at the bottom) or dynamic (rotating), adjustable in settings.
- **Advanced animations**:
  - Community card reveal with 3D spin
  - Chip movement with parabolic arc
  - Winner hand text with per‑theme font & colour
  - All‑in delayed community card reveal (2s between streets)
- **Visual indicators** – admin crown, SB/BB badges, dealer badge (hidden until the first hand starts).

### 🔊 Sound Effects (Web Audio API)
- **No audio files required** – all sounds generated live with Web Audio API.
- Card dealing, chip clicking, winner fanfare, timer beep, and a rich all‑in coin‑machine sound.

### 📊 Noob Mode
- A live probability bar shows your chance of winning the hand (Monte Carlo simulation, 2000 trials).
- Colour‑coded: green (low) → orange (medium) → red (high).

### 🏆 Achievements
- Only ultra‑rare moments unlock achievements now—no more spammy notifications.
- Examples: winning with a Royal Flush, dragging a million‑chip pot, a 10‑hand win streak, or winning a hand after being reduced to exactly 1 chip.

### 💬 Chat & Quick Chat
- Table chat with persistent history.
- **Speech bubbles** appear above the sender’s seat.
- **Quick Chat pad** – one‑click emoji messages in three categories (Emotions, Game, Greetings).
- **Private messages** – use `/w PlayerName` to whisper directly to someone (purple styling, visible only to sender and receiver).
- Chat panel auto‑hides after a few seconds of inactivity.

### 👤 Player Stats & History
- Expandable leaderboard showing hands played, pots won, losses, biggest pot, best hand, and win rate.
- **Hand history** – view recent hands from the settings menu.

### 🛡️ Other Improvements
- Auto‑fold when the acting player disconnects—no more frozen tables.
- Structured JSON logger on the server for live debugging.
- Chat panel always stays on top of chips, seats, and cards.

## 🌈 Customisation
- **Add new themes** – edit `themes.css` and add a new entry in the `themes` array inside `GameTable.jsx`.
- All theme‑dependent colors are controlled by CSS custom properties (`--table-bg`, `--winner-text`, etc.).
- Card backs and other personalisation options are stored in `localStorage`.

And I would like you to know that I have used many models to build this project so far, such as:
`Qwen3.6` `gemma-4` `deepseek`
